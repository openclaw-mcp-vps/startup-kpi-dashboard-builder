# Build Task: startup-kpi-dashboard-builder

Build a complete, production-ready Next.js 15 App Router application.

PROJECT: startup-kpi-dashboard-builder
HEADLINE: Drag-and-drop KPI dashboards for startups
WHAT: Pre-built dashboard templates for common startup metrics, connects to Stripe, Google Analytics, and other tools via APIs
WHY: Early-stage founders waste weeks building custom dashboards instead of focusing on product, existing tools are too complex
WHO PAYS: Pre-seed and seed stage startup founders
NICHE: startup-growth-tools
PRICE: $$25/mo

ARCHITECTURE SPEC:
Next.js SaaS with React Flow for drag-and-drop dashboard building, Prisma for data persistence, and API routes for third-party integrations. Users authenticate, connect data sources via OAuth, and build custom dashboards using pre-built metric widgets that auto-populate with real data.

PLANNED FILES:
- app/page.tsx
- app/dashboard/page.tsx
- app/dashboard/builder/page.tsx
- app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
- app/api/integrations/stripe/route.ts
- app/api/integrations/google-analytics/route.ts
- app/api/dashboards/route.ts
- app/api/webhooks/lemonsqueezy/route.ts
- components/dashboard-builder.tsx
- components/metric-widgets/revenue-widget.tsx
- components/metric-widgets/user-growth-widget.tsx
- components/integration-setup.tsx
- lib/integrations/stripe.ts
- lib/integrations/google-analytics.ts
- lib/auth.ts
- lib/db.ts
- prisma/schema.prisma

DEPENDENCIES: next, react, typescript, tailwindcss, prisma, @prisma/client, next-auth, reactflow, recharts, stripe, googleapis, @lemonsqueezy/lemonsqueezy.js, zod, lucide-react, framer-motion

REQUIREMENTS:
- Next.js 15 with App Router (app/ directory)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components (npx shadcn@latest init, then add needed components)
- Dark theme ONLY — background #0d1117, no light mode
- Stripe Payment Link for payments (hosted checkout — use the URL directly as the Buy button href)
- Landing page that converts: hero, problem, solution, pricing, FAQ
- The actual tool/feature behind a paywall (cookie-based access after purchase)
- Mobile responsive
- SEO meta tags, Open Graph tags
- /api/health endpoint that returns {"status":"ok"}
- NO HEAVY ORMs: Do NOT use Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, Sequelize, or Mongoose. If the tool needs persistence, use direct SQL via `pg` (Postgres) or `better-sqlite3` (local), or just filesystem JSON. Reason: these ORMs require schema files and codegen steps that fail on Vercel when misconfigured.
- INTERNAL FILE DISCIPLINE: Every internal import (paths starting with `@/`, `./`, or `../`) MUST refer to a file you actually create in this build. If you write `import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card"`, then `components/ui/card.tsx` MUST exist with a real `export const Card` (or `export default Card`). Before finishing, scan all internal imports and verify every target file exists. Do NOT use shadcn/ui patterns unless you create every component from scratch — easier path: write all UI inline in the page that uses it.
- DEPENDENCY DISCIPLINE: Every package imported in any .ts, .tsx, .js, or .jsx file MUST be
  listed in package.json dependencies (or devDependencies for build-only). Before finishing,
  scan all source files for `import` statements and verify every external package (anything
  not starting with `.` or `@/`) appears in package.json. Common shadcn/ui peers that MUST
  be added if used:
  - lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge, class-variance-authority
  - react-hook-form, zod, @hookform/resolvers
  - @radix-ui/* (for any shadcn component)
- After running `npm run build`, if you see "Module not found: Can't resolve 'X'", add 'X'
  to package.json dependencies and re-run npm install + npm run build until it passes.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (create .env.example):
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK  (full URL, e.g. https://buy.stripe.com/test_XXX)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY  (pk_test_... or pk_live_...)
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET  (set when webhook is wired)

BUY BUTTON RULE: the Buy button's href MUST be `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK`
used as-is — do NOT construct URLs from a product ID, do NOT prepend any base URL,
do NOT wrap it in an embed iframe. The link opens Stripe's hosted checkout directly.

After creating all files:
1. Run: npm install
2. Run: npm run build
3. Fix any build errors
4. Verify the build succeeds with exit code 0

Do NOT use placeholder text. Write real, helpful content for the landing page
and the tool itself. The tool should actually work and provide value.
